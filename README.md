# intellij-mocha-mouse-dark-theme

Mocha Mouse is another colorful dark theme for PhpStorm and other IntelliJ-based IDEs, inspired by Mocha Mousse, Pantone's color of the year 2025, based on openmindculture's Cute Pink Dark theme.

**BETA: This theme is usable, but still unfinished!**

If you like to support development, you can open a pull request [on GitHub](https://github.com/openmindculture/intellij-cute-pink-dark-theme).

For JetBrains IDEs, version 2020.2 and above. Tested up to 2024.2.4 (242). It will probably work on older builds like 2019.1 as well, but untested.

To install:
- Go to Settings (Preferences) | Plugins, find the theme plugin and install it
- (_or_ download from JetBrains Plugins page
- Restart IDE
- Go to Settings (Preferences) | Appearance & Behavior | Appearance and see the Theme dropdown

<!-- Plugin description end -->

If you only want to install the theme, you do not need this repository.
You can install the theme from JB marketplace (inside your IDE) or install zip file (see below).

### Local Installation

In `build/distributions` there is a zip file that I can manually import into my regular PhpStorm installation (Settings -> Plugins -> Gear Icon -> install plugin from disk).

### Development

#### Shell Build (beta)

`npm run build`

- requires `bash`/`sh`!
- creates a `build/distributions/intellij-mocha-mouse-dark-theme-x.y.z.zip`
